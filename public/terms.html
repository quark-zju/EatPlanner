      <p class="muted">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Eat Planner ("the App"). By using
          the App, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. What the App Does</h2>
      <p>
        Eat Planner helps you track pantry foods, generate meal plans based on nutrition goals, and
        save meal history.
      </p>

      <h2>2. AI Photo Recognition</h2>
      <p>
        If enabled by you, the App can analyze nutrition labels or food photos using your OpenAI
        or Google Gemini API key to pre-fill nutrition values. You are responsible for any API
        charges from the respective provider. Use of these services is subject to their terms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenAI Terms of Use</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gemini API Additional Terms of Service</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Google Services</h2>
      <p>
        Eat Planner utilizes Google services for backup and optionally for AI recognition. Your use
        is subject to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google APIs Terms of Service</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Google Drive:</strong> If you connect Google Drive, the App uses Google APIs only
          to save and load your backup data for this App in a private application-specific folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gemini API:</strong> If you use the Gemini AI recognition feature, the App sends
          images directly to Google services using your API key.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data and Storage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your app data is stored locally in your browser by default.</li>
        <li>
          If you choose Google Drive sync, backups are stored in the app's private Google Drive app
          data area.
        </li>
        <li>The developer does not automatically receive or view your personal food data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for the accuracy of your own entries.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for reviewing any nutrition estimates generated from photos.</li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for keeping your own devices, browser profile, and Google account
          secure.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should keep your own backups (for example using Export) if data retention is
          important to you.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. No Medical Advice</h2>
      <p>
        The App is for planning and record-keeping only. It does not provide medical, nutrition,
        diagnosis, or treatment advice. Consult qualified professionals for medical or dietary
        decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Availability and Changes</h2>
      <p>
        The App may change over time and may be temporarily unavailable. Features can be added,
        modified, or removed without notice.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, to the
        extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for indirect, incidental,
        special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for data loss resulting from use of the
        App.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Open Source and Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Eat Planner source code is available in the project repository for audit and review. The
        repository is the canonical implementation of App behavior.
      </p>
