      <h1>Eat Planner Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Eat Planner ("the App"). By using
          the App, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. What the App Does</h2>
      <p>
        Eat Planner helps you track pantry foods, generate meal plans based on nutrition goals, and
        save meal history.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data and Storage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your app data is stored locally in your browser by default.</li>
        <li>
          If you choose Google Drive sync, backups are stored in the app's private Google Drive app
          data area.
        </li>
        <li>The developer does not automatically receive or view your personal food data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Google API Services</h2>
      <p>
        If you connect Google Drive, the App uses Google APIs only to save and load your backup
        data for this App. The App requests only the permissions needed for that purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for the accuracy of your own entries.</li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for keeping your own devices, browser profile, and Google account
          secure.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should keep your own backups (for example using Export) if data retention is
          important to you.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. No Medical Advice</h2>
      <p>
        The App is for planning and record-keeping only. It does not provide medical, nutrition,
        diagnosis, or treatment advice. Consult qualified professionals for medical or dietary
        decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Availability and Changes</h2>
      <p>
        The App may change over time and may be temporarily unavailable. Features can be added,
        modified, or removed without notice.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, to the
        extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for indirect, incidental,
        special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for data loss resulting from use of the
        App.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Open Source and Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Eat Planner source code is available in the project repository for audit and review. The
        repository is the canonical implementation of App behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        For questions about these Terms, use the contact method listed in the project repository.
      </p>
