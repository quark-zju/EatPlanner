      <h1>Privacy Policy for Eat Planner</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains what data Eat Planner processes and where it is stored.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Eat Planner is a nutrition planning tool. It is designed so your food, goals,
          and planning data stay under your control.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data We Process</h2>
        <p>The app can process the following data that you enter:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Food items, nutrition values, stock, and optional prices.</li>
          <li>Optional photos you submit for nutrition label or food recognition.</li>
          <li>Nutrition goals and planner constraints.</li>
          <li>Export/import payloads created by the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Where Data Is Stored</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Default:</strong> Data is stored locally in your browser storage
            (<code>localStorage</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>OpenAI API key:</strong> Stored only in <code>localStorage</code>. It is never
            included in Google Drive sync or export/import.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optional Google Drive sync:</strong> If you connect Google Drive,
            the app stores a backup JSON file in your Google Drive
            <code>appDataFolder</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. OpenAI API Use</h2>
        <p>
          If enabled by you, the app sends the image and prompt directly from your browser to
          OpenAI's API using your API key to extract nutrition details.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app does not route this data through a developer-operated server.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Google User Data and API Scope</h2>
        <p>
          If enabled by you, the app uses Google Drive scope
          <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata</code> to read and write
          only the app's own backup file in <code>appDataFolder</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app does not request broad file access and does not read or modify other
          Drive files.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          The app developer does not receive your planner data by default. Data is not
          transmitted to a developer-operated backend as part of normal app use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data may be shared only when you explicitly export, copy, or upload it using
          services you choose.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Local data remains in your browser until you clear it or overwrite it.</li>
          <li>
            Google Drive backup remains until you delete it from your Drive app data or
            overwrite it from the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can delete local data by clearing browser storage for this site.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>
          The app uses OAuth for Google authentication and stores tokens in browser
          runtime state. No client secret is embedded in frontend code.
        </p>
        <p>
          No internet-facing system is perfectly secure, but the app follows a minimal
          data-access approach and least-privilege API scope.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Open Source and Auditability</h2>
        <p>
          The app source code is publicly auditable on GitHub:
          <a href="https://github.com/quark-zju/EatPlanner">
            https://github.com/quark-zju/EatPlanner
          </a>
        </p>

        <h2>10. Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>
          This policy may be updated as the app changes. The "Last updated" date will be
          revised when updates are made.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Contact</h2>

        <h2>12. Google API Services Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          Eat Planner's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will
          adhere to the
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
